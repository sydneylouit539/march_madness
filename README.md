# March Madness repo
This will contain codes to calculate March Madness win probabilities, and 
contains code existing all the way back to 2019. The goal for 2024 is to 
have all codes uploaded to GitHub for public consumption.




## Tournament runs
In the past few seasons, we have seen several teams, like Princeton and 
St. Peter's which have made runs that would be considered almost impossible 
im previous models. This new 2024 model will account for what happens when 
Cinderella teams are able to pull off the first upset. Teams can get better
(or worse) over the course of a tournament, so this may improve the 
log-likelihood in model evaluation.
